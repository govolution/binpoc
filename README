Here are some PoCs from the development of BFG.

inject_sc.c
Inject shellcode into a running process. 

inject_sc64.c
Same for 64bit. Seems you can not inject 32bit code into a 64bit process.

EnumProcesses.c
Enumarates processes, from MS.

getpidbyname.c
Search for a process by name and returns pid.

Notes
Get pid on cmd: tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq notepad.exe"
Some parts of the code are from syringe: https://github.com/govolution/syringe
